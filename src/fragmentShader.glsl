// Imagine cutting the image into nStrips strips along the x-axis. Rearrange the strips by taking the first strip,
// then the last strip, then the second strip, then the second last strip, etc. Do the same for the y-axis. This `cutup`
// function is equivalent to running this process nShuffles times. Each step of the process results in a predictable
// column order, so instead of actually iterating, we do it in one shot by aliasing values on a triangle wave.
//
// This solution requires some upfront work on the CPU to calculate the step size, but we only need to do that once. If
// there’s a more elegant solution, I’d be interested to see it. I searched for a weekend and finally gave up. Some
// breadcrumbs:

//
// The solution I ended up with isn’t related to the above. All the numbers in a shuffled sequence have a consistent
// stepSize between them on a triangle wave with magnitude nStrips - 0.5. For instance, after shuffling 7 columns twice,
// the order is: 1, 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 6. All of these numbers intersect with a triangle wave with height 7.5 and a stepSize
// of 3. So with just the stepSize, we can draw the final configuration without having to iterate.
